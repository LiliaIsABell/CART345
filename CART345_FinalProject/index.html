    <p id="title"> You Can Say It </p>
    <p id="presentation">
      For my final project, I wanted to create
      an interactive activity that reproduces
      how it feels to struggle to say certain words.
      I have met many people who have difficulty
      saying certain simple sentences such as
      “I love you”, “I am sorry” or “I disagree”.
      They often feel awkward saying those words
      either because of the way they were raised
      or because they are uncomfortable with being
      vulnerable.
      <br><br>
      The words moving around represents the mind
      running and being overwhelmed by the multitude
      of thoughts going around. I chose to make the
      activity drag and drop because I felt that it emphasizes
      the struggle of finding the right words to say
      and selecting them.
      <br><br>
      The purpose of this project is to encourage the
      participant to say those words and hopefully get
      to a point where they no longer feel embarrassed
      to say them.
      <br><br>
      This project was made using jQuery for the
      activity and Annyang to allow voice recognition.
      Because of the use Annyang, this project will be
      more effective if used on Chrome.

    <p id="instructions">
      In a blue box, there are words moving around
      within it. These words can be dragged and
      dropped to the blank box below to form one
      of the sentences below:
      <br><br>
      - I am sorry
      <br>
      - I was wrong
      <br>
      - I love you
      <br>
      - I need help
      <br>
      - Please stop
      <br>
      - I want this
      <br>
      - In my opinion
      <br>
      - I disagree
      <br><br>
      If one of these are formed, the screen will
      clear ending the activity and you can stop
      or refresh the page to try again. However,
      dragging and dropping is too difficult, you can say it. Say
      the sentence loud and comprehensively and the screen
      will clear.
